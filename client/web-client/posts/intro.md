Hey, I'm Daniel Prilik.

# And This is Yet Another Music Blog.

I listen to music.

A lot.

I listen to it while I

- commute
- code
- walk to class in the morning
- walk from class in the afternoon
- study for class
- slack off from class
- am in class
- etc..

And, well, if I'm already listening to music, I might as well share what I'm listening to with the world.

Don't expect any 10/10, prefectly written, critically impressive reviews, because, well...

I'm just some guy.

Who likes music.

Enjoy!
