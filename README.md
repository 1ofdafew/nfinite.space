# Nfinite.space
### Give a little, get a lot

Nfinite.space is a cloud storage service that does things differently. In exchange for a small amount of space on your disk, we'll give you much more space in the cloud. But here's the trick, we don't actually store your data. Our algorithms intelligently dissemble your files and distributes them to other users computers, with some redundancy. Don't worry though, your files are always safe with end-to-end encryption built in. 

Nfinite.space utilizes the latest technologies, such as [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/), websockets, Go, and of course, Node JS.
